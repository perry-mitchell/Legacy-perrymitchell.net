I pride myself in being a web and applications developer, and there's a few projects that I'm extremely proud of.

## [Aivoterveydeksi!](/aivoterveydeksi)
I built this app as a donation to the Finnish memory association Muistiliitto, which is available on iPhones and iPads.

## [Mine Control](/mine-control)
I love Minecraft! It's an amazing game that I've spent many hours playing. I enjoy it so much that I wrote a remote-control app for it, available on iOS.
