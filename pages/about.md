Welcome!

I'm an Australian web and applications developer that currently resides in Helsinki, Finland. I love programming in general, though I specialise in **JavaScript** and **NodeJS**. I'm proficient in iOS platform development and have dabbled in many other languages, environments and operating systems.

I showcase some of [my apps on this website](/applications), and I'm very active on [Github](https://github.com/perry-mitchell) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/perry_mitchell). You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/perry-mitchell-ab954baa).

I also blog on an awesome site called [CafeDev](https://cafedev.org), which I run with my good friend and colleague [Sallar](https://sallar.me/).
