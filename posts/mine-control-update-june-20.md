The app has been re-released in to the app store! Hopefully it's only days away this time... It's a huge change, one which I'm very keen to see the outcome of in regards existing customers. The new app supports both vanilla and Bukkit server builds as well as having a new command console.

The app's price will increase to about $1.99 USD on the 30th of June 2013... So make sure you grab it before then, half price!
